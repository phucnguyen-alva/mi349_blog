            <p>7 p.m. The excitement inside me has been building since the beginning of the week. Today is the day. I booked my ticket for this show two months ago, and now, the day has finally arrived: I'm going to see Les Misérables at MSU. I can't believe MSU has brought Broadway so close to students. When I first arrived in the U.S. two years ago (time flies!), I thought the only way to see a Broadway show was by going to New York or Chicago. Guess what? This year, I can watch five Broadway shows with just a five-minute walk from my dorm—I live in Owen Hall, and the Wharton Center is right across the street. 8 p.m. I'm in the theater, and it's amazing. The quality of the lighting, sound, music production, and the whole experience is overwhelming. I can't help but cry. I read the book five years ago, and now, seeing it come to life on stage brings up so many emotions that I can't fully describe. While the musical is an adaptation and doesn't cover the characters' lives in full detail, small narratives surrounding each character spark memories from when I read the book. I read it during the COVID-19 lockdown and felt as though I was living alongside the characters. Stepping back from my personal experience, I have to admire the talent of the cast. Their powerful voices carry through every song in the musical. It's a three-hour performance, yet their energy is so dynamic and enthusiastic. I can feel their passion from the audience. The lighting, too, is absolutely on point, shaping the emotional experience of the audience. It's cinematic. I vividly remember the end of Act I when a large light in the right corner of the stage gave the feeling of light at the end of a tunnel—a symbol of hope. Such an abstract concept, but they made it tangible. Or the light in Act II streaming through the window at the bar—it felt so real, like the characters and their world were right there in front of me.
    
            This has been an excellent cathartic experience, reviving my energy and emotions for the whole semester. I love reading classics, but seeing them adapted into other forms like movies and musicals makes me appreciate them even more. It feels like I got the chance to embrace all the characters after years of not seeing them. And yes, I cried during that scene. Gavroche's death—it hits me every time, in every medium. It is the peak of emotion from the power of art that I've been seeking for.




            Thursday morning. On a bus. I came across an intriguing piece of news: the announcement of the Nobel Prize in Literature.</p>

            <p>"Who could it be?" I pondered, my curiosity piqued. Admittedly, I had no clear guess as to the winner—there are simply too many exceptional authors, each contributing their unique voice to the literary world, striving to articulate ideas that transcend conventional language.

            This year's laureate was Han Kang from South Korea—a name unfamiliar to my usual literary repertoire. However, the title of her acclaimed work, The Vegetarian, immediately captured my interest. It repeatedly appeared in my newsfeed. During my high school years, I specialized in literature, which provided me opportunities to engage deeply with professors and experts in the field. When the prize was announced, many of them shared their reflections on Han Kang. Most admitted to having read her work only once, yet it left a profound and persuasive impression on them.

            The premise of The Vegetarian is fascinating: set in contemporary Seoul, it narrates the story of a part-time graphic artist and homemaker whose decision to renounce meat consumption after a disturbing, blood-soaked nightmare about human cruelty leads to catastrophic consequences in her personal and familial life. The novel is structured as a series of interconnected short stories rather than a continuous narrative, reflecting the fragmented yet unified nature of human experience—much like life itself, where seemingly disparate days are woven into a larger narrative fabric. There are numerous layers of symbolism and psychological nuance embedded in this work, inviting deeper interpretation and analysis. I've now added it to my expanding reading list—perhaps it will be the perfect choice for a reflective winter break.

            A lingering thought remains: when will we see a Vietnamese author claim the Nobel Prize in Literature as well?
